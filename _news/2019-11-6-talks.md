Two talks coming up!  I will be [I2M - Universit√© de Bordeaux](https://www.i2m.u-bordeaux.fr/en) on Nov. 8 talking about solving PDEs with neural networks, and on Nov. 14 I will participate in a flash workshop on numerical methods for plasma at CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique, where I will be promoting [Mutation++](https://github.com/mutationpp/Mutationpp).
