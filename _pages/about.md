The main objective of my research is to improve the current state-of-the-art models, data, and algorithms necessary to perform predictive simulations of the aerothermal environment surrounding atmospheric entry vehicles.  In particular, my work has focused on developing a better understanding of the complex, multi-scale, phenomena that occur between the radiating, shock-heated gases enveloping atmospheric entry vehicles and the response of the thermal protection materials used to insulate the vehicles from the intense heating.
