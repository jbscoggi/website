The development of the Mutation++ library is described which has been designed to compute thermodynamic and transport properties of ionized gases including equilibrium compositions and species production rates due to finite-rate elementary reactions.Thermodynamic properties are obtained from three separate databases: the NASA 7- and 9-coefficient polynomials and a custom database which describes each atom and molecule as a rigid-rotator and harmonic oscillator. Mixture thermodynamic properties are suitably formulated from species quantities. Transport properties are derived from kinetic theory which provides relationships for macroscopic transport coefficients based on microscopic collision integrals. The chemical production rates for species based on elementary chemical reactions including third body reactions is detailed. In addition, a new module providing atomic line spectra and statistical narrow-band model parameters for gas molecules is outlined and its application to radiative transfer calculations in atmospheric entry environments is discussed.
